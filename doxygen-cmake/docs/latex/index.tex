\subsection*{Use in your project}


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 cd yourproject
2 git clone EmptyDoxygenCMake doc
3 rm -rf doc/.git
\end{DoxyCode}


Edit {\ttfamily doc/doxygen/\+Doxyfile.\+in} {\itshape I\+N\+P\+UT} and {\itshape S\+T\+R\+I\+P\+\_\+\+F\+R\+O\+M\+\_\+\+P\+A\+TH} to fit your project. Also you can change where the documentation will be installed in {\ttfamily doc/\+C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt} in the first $\ast$\#\+T\+O\+DO$\ast$ section. If you do not want your documentation to be part of installation, just leave the section commented.

To your main C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt you want to add {\ttfamily add\+\_\+subdirectory(doc)} in order to include documentation build.

\subsection*{Standalone doc builder}

Sometimes you just need to build docs from some pile of sources, and here can this repository help you. You may not even have a C\+Make Project setup yet, in this case you need to uncomment code after second $\ast$\#\+T\+O\+DO$\ast$ section in {\ttfamily doc/\+C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt} and documentation will act as a standalone C\+Make project.

\subsubsection*{Prerequisites}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item C\+Make 3.\+2 and newer
\item C++14 capable compiler
\item Doxygen for docs ({\itshape Graphviz for more graphs in docs, Plant\+U\+ML for more U\+ML diagrams}, Plant\+U\+ML needs java)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{Linux}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Arch Linux\+: {\ttfamily sudo pacman -\/S cmake g++ graphviz git}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item download plantuml.\+jar and have it somewhere where {\itshape P\+A\+TH} points to
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item Ubuntu 16.\+04\+: {\ttfamily sudo apt-\/get install cmake g++ graphviz plantuml git}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{Windows}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Install msys2 and install these packages\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily mingw32/mingw-\/w64-\/i686-\/gcc mingw32/mingw-\/w64-\/i686-\/cmake git mingw32/mingw-\/w64-\/i686-\/make msys/make msys/doxygen msys/make}
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item For graphs in documentation install Graphviz (to {\ttfamily c\+:\textbackslash{}Program Files\textbackslash{}Graphviz}, so scripts can find it) and add its {\ttfamily bin} subdirectory to {\itshape P\+A\+TH}, install java (have it on {\itshape P\+A\+TH}), download Plant\+U\+ML jar file and have it on {\itshape P\+A\+TH}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Building doc}

You can use {\itshape doc} target to build and {\itshape install} target to install the documentation (if installation part of C\+Make\+Lists.\+txt is uncommented).

Documentation will be in your {\ttfamily \mbox{[}build\+\_\+directory\mbox{]}/doc/index.html} or {\ttfamily \mbox{[}build\+\_\+directory\mbox{]}/doc/doc/index.html} depending of whether used as standalone or as a C\+Make subdirectory.
